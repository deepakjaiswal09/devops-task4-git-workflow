# DevOps Internship â€“ Task 4 Report

## Overview
This task focused on learning practical **Git and GitHub workflows** as part of the DevOps internship.  
I created a GitHub repository named **devops-task4-git-workflow**, added a simple Python application, and followed standard branching and pull-request practices.

## Key Actions
- Initialized a local Git repository and connected it to GitHub.  
- Created branches: `main`, `dev`, and a feature branch for changes.  
- Added a `.gitignore` file and a sample `app.py` script.  
- Committed changes, pushed them to GitHub, and merged through Pull Requests.  
- Tagged the first stable release as **v1.0**.  
- Documented the process with `README.md` and this `docs.md`.

## Outcome
Successfully demonstrated:
- **Branching and merging** using Git.
- **Pull request workflow** for collaborative development.
- Use of **tags** and **markdown documentation**.
