# DevOps Internship â€“ Task 4  
**Project:** Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to manage a DevOps project using **Git best practices** including repository initialization, branching, pull requests, tagging, and documentation.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Git  
- GitHub

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Sample code file
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore # Ignored files and folders

## ðŸ“š Interview Prep (from this task)
1. **What is Git?** â†’ A distributed version control system.  
2. **Merge vs Rebase?** â†’ Merge combines histories; Rebase makes history linear.  
3. **What is a Pull Request?** â†’ A request to merge code changes from one branch to another.  
4. **How do you resolve merge conflicts?** â†’ Manually edit conflicting files, then commit resolved changes.  
5. **What are Git tags?** â†’ Labels pointing to specific commits (used for releases).  
6. **What is Git workflow?** â†’ Strategy for managing branches, commits, and releases.  
7. **Explain git stash.** â†’ Temporarily saves uncommitted changes.  
8. **What is the use of .gitignore?** â†’ Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.

# âœ… Acknowledgement

I successfully completed DevOps Internship â€“ Task 4, which focused on implementing a full Git workflow.
During this task I:
-Created and managed branches (main, dev, feature/login)
-Performed commits and pushes following best practices
-Raised and merged Pull Requests from feature/login â†’ dev and dev â†’ main
-Used tags and markdown documentation (README.md, docs.md)
-This task strengthened my understanding of version control, branching strategies, and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.
